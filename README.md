# Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Survey 

This document gathers a survey on the most relevant paper in the field of GNN and RL for the following specific applications:

- **GNNs for social navigation**: These works make use of the GNNs and RL for helping or guiding a robot navigate safely across a room. Some of them consider the social aspects of the navigation.

All the papers are ordered by year of publication, and they can have different general types as indicated in the table below:

| Type        | `M`            | `A`            | `other`     |
|:----------- |:--------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| Explanation | Model descriptions | Applications | Other types |
